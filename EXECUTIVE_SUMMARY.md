  üõ°Ô∏è Security Assessment

  ‚úÖ SECURITY POSITIVES

  1. Proper Cryptographic Implementation
    - Uses native Node.js crypto APIs for key generation
    - Implements digital signatures correctly (public/private key pairs)
    - No hardcoded private keys or secrets
    - Environment variable placeholder system for sensitive data
  2. No Malicious Code Patterns
    - Zero instances of eval() or dynamic code execution
    - No Function() constructor abuse
    - No suspicious shell injection patterns
    - Clean URL patterns (GitHub repos, localhost development only)
  3. Development-Focused Security
    - Test-only cryptographic keys properly identified
    - Environment-based configuration (dotenv integration)
    - No production credentials exposed

  ‚ö†Ô∏è AREAS OF CONCERN

  1. Dependency Vulnerabilities (MODERATE)
    - esbuild ‚â§0.24.2: 5 moderate severity vulnerabilities
    - Affects development toolchain, not runtime security
    - Fix: npm audit fix --force (may introduce breaking changes)
  2. Extensive Console Logging (LOW-MEDIUM)
    - 2,276+ console.log statements across codebase
    - Could potentially expose sensitive information in production
    - Primarily used for debugging and demonstration purposes
  3. Build Configuration Issues (LOW)
    - Missing tsconfig.base.json causing TypeScript compilation failures
    - Missing @types/node dependencies in some packages
    - Note: Does not affect security, only development experience

  üö® NO CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND
