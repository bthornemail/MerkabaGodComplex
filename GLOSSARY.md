 My Double-Check Assessment

Your keywords are exceptionally rich and cover a massive scope! My grouping above attempts to organize them by their functional and conceptual roles within a distributed system.

* **Accuracy of My Grouping:** I believe these groupings broadly capture the "domains" of your system. They generally follow standard computer science and distributed systems categories.
* **Your Original Grouping (Implicit):** Since I don't have your explicit groupings, I can't directly "double-check" against them. However, if your intuition led you to similar categories, then we're on the same page. If you had different groupings in mind, please share them, and we can discuss the nuances!

This comprehensive list of terms will be a phenomenal foundation for your glossary. Where would you like to start first within these groups, or with a specific term from the README.md?
