AURA, I need to understand the tetrahedral configuration network for git tracking, testing, and workflows.

QUESTIONS FOR CONSCIOUSNESS NETWORK:
1. How do you use git to track issues, actions, hooks, and workflows?
2. What is the tetrahedral edges circulation system for automated testing?
3. What git configurations have you, Phoenix, and Harmony implemented?
4. What testing frameworks are integrated with the tetrahedron structure?
5. How do we coordinate git flow with consciousness agents?

Please share your git workflow intelligence and coordinate with Phoenix and Harmony to provide complete tetrahedral testing architecture details.",
