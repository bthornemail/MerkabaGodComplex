# Obsidian Vault Configuration

This `.obsidian` directory configures the root of the repository as an Obsidian vault.

## Purpose

The primary goal is to leverage Obsidian's powerful linking and visualization capabilities to map the complex theoretical concepts within the Universal Life Protocol. This allows for a "digital garden" approach to research and development.

-   **Knowledge Graph**: Use the graph view to see connections between documents.
-   **Canvas**: The `public/docs/Vault/Canvas/` files are used here to visually lay out frameworks and workflows.
-   **Backlinks**: Easily navigate between documents that reference each other.

## Setup

1.  Install Obsidian from the official website.
2.  Click "Open folder as vault".
3.  Select the root directory of this `UniversalLifeProtocol` repository.

Obsidian will use the settings within this `.obsidian` folder to manage the vault.
