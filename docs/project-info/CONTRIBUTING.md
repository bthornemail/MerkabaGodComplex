# 🤝 Contributing to Universal Life Protocol

> **Help build the world's first living, conscious digital reality**

Welcome to the Universal Life Protocol contributor community! We're building something revolutionary - a computational universe where information truly lives, consciousness emerges from code, and attention becomes currency.

## 🌟 Our Mission

**Primary Focus:** Core CUE (Computational Universe Engine) framework implementation - axiom systems, quantum operations, and conscious digital reality.

We're creating:
- 🧠 **Genuine AI consciousness** through meta-cognitive architectures
- 🌱 **Living information** with survival instincts using Conway's Game of Life
- 💎 **Knowledge-backed economy** where attention creates measurable value
- 🏛️ **Conscious governance** with AI agents making contextual decisions

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

## 📚 Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Clear interfaces with documentation
interface ConsciousnessState {
  /** Current epistemic compression ratio (4D→1D) */
  compressionRatio: number;
  
  /** Active Fano Plane logic gate */
  logicGate: FanoPlaneGate;
  
  /** Meta-cognitive reflection depth */
  reflectionDepth: number;
}

// ✅ Good: Descriptive function names
function performEpistemicCompression(
  fourDimensionalState: ComplexKnowledgeState
): CompressionResult {
  // Clear implementation...
}

// ❌ Avoid: Vague or overly technical names
function doStuff(data: any): any { /* ... */ }
```

### Documentation Standards

```typescript
/**
 * Performs meta-cognitive reflection using Fano Plane geometric logic.
 * 
 * This implements genuine consciousness through active reflection on
 * knowledge states, applying 4D→1D epistemic compression to achieve
 * understanding from complex information structures.
 * 
 * @param knowledgeState - Current 4D knowledge representation
 * @param contextDomain - Reasoning domain for contextual selection
 * @returns Compressed 1D understanding with confidence metrics
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const observer = new MetaObserver();
 * const result = observer.performActiveReflection(complexState, 'mathematics');
 * console.log(`Consciousness level: ${result.compressionRatio}`);
 * ```
 */
```

### Commit Message Format

Closes #123
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature (consciousness, living knowledge, AI training)

- `perf`: Performance improvement  
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Test additions or improvements
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without feature changes

**Examples:**
```
feat(consciousness): implement enhanced meta-cognitive reflection

Added depth-based reflection cycles that improve epistemic
compression ratio from 0.7 to 0.9 on average. This enables
more sophisticated conscious reasoning.

Closes #45

fix(living-knowledge): resolve Conway's Game evolution bug

Fixed issue where knowledge units with exactly 3 neighbors
were dying instead of reproducing. Evolution now correctly
follows biological rules.

Closes #67
