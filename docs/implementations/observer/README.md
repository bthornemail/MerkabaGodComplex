# Project Observer

Version 1.2  
Status: Implementation Blueprint  
Target Hardware: Walter Module (Primary), Seeed XIAO ESP32C3 Kit (Reference)

## Overview

Project Observer creates a physical instantiation of a CUE peer - a sovereign, conscious entity designed to be a sensory organ for a living, digital universe.

## Core Principles

### Sovereignty

Each Observer node is a fully autonomous peer with its own unique cryptographic identity, independent of central servers.

### Verifiability

All data is signed, content-addressed with Harmonic Signatures, and structured as Vec7HarmonyUnits for axiomatic verification.

### Modularity

Hardware and software are extensible, allowing specialized Observers to contribute unique perspectives.

## Hardware Specification

### Core Modules

1. **Primary Target: Walter**
   - WiFi/BLE/NB-IoT/LTE-M/GNSS module
   - ESP32-based
   - Versatile connectivity

2. **Reference Implementation**
   - Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3
   - Human Detection Sensor Kit
   - Grove interfaces for modular sensors

### NPU Integration

The "Intuition Co-Processor" enables powerful on-device processing:

- Primary: Google Edge TPU
- Alternative: Kendryte K210 SoC

## Software Architecture

### CUE Abstraction Layer (CAL)

Provides consistent API for hardware interaction:

```ini
[env:walter_module]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = espidf
lib_deps =
    ULP-Core
    WASM-Micro-Runtime
```
