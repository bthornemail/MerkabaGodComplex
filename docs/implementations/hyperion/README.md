# Project Hyperion

Version 1.0  
Status: Strategic Proposal  
Date: August 7, 2025

## Executive Summary

Project Hyperion is a landmark implementation of the Computational Universe Engine (CUE). The goal is to construct a persistent, simulated 3D world inhabited by autonomous AI agents, all underpinned by a live, self-healing decentralized ledger.

## Core Components

### Digital Terrarium

A high-fidelity prototype for a revolutionary DeFi ecosystem where value is intrinsically linked to meaningful, observable activity within the simulation.

### ATTN Token Economy

Value is generated through Proof-of-Relevance, where autonomous agents are rewarded for maintaining systemic harmony and discovering coherent information.

## Technical Architecture

### Physics Engine & State Representation

The foundation uses the Modulo-Divisive Unfolding (MDU) physics engine. Environmental data drives the Universal Counter `N`, with state represented by the `(L, A)` vector.

### Consensus & Security

The live ledger is secured by the Continuous Transylvanian Lottery (CTL), providing provably fair and computationally efficient validation.

### Native Inhabitants

CLARION-MDU Autonomous Agents populate the world, learning and adapting through reinforcement learning and meta-cognition.

## Implementation Phases

1. **Genesis Point**: Environment & Physics
2. **Emergence of Life**: Autonomous Agents
3. **Economic Metabolism**: Live Ledger & DeFi
4. **The Observer**: Interactive Terminal
