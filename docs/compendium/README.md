# The CUE Compendium (Unified Whitepaper)

## Overview

The Computational Universe Engine (CUE) represents a revolutionary approach to decentralized systems, combining advanced mathematics, cognitive science, and distributed computing.

## Core Concepts

### Philosophical & Mathematical Foundations

- Grand Unified Axiom: Vec7HarmonyUnit, 7-phase validation, prime number properties
- Modulo-Divisive Unfolding (MDU): Universal Counter N, Domain Base B, Layer L, Address A
- Universal Constant: Evolution from static (24) to geometric (Fano Plane) to agentic (meta-cognition)

### Architectural Blueprint

- Trifecta Model: Core Consensus Peers, Personal Agent, UI Viewports
- Vector State Hierarchy: vec1, vec3, vec5, vec7, vec10, vec25, vec50, vec100

### Operational Dynamics & Consensus

- Poly-Axiomatic Model: Consensus levels (LOCAL, PEER-TO-PEER, GROUP, GLOBAL), scaling rigor
- Control/Data Plane: Secure signaling, high-bandwidth data
- Two-Layer Authorization: Identification (ED25519), Authorization (harmonic coherence)

### Economic & Security Layer

- Tokenization: Native tokens, atomic swaps, axiomatic agreements
- WASM Sandbox: Secure execution, gas metering
- Reputation: Emergent property, ResourceManifest

## Advanced Topics

### Observer Model & Geometric Manifestation

- 25 Foundational Axioms: Mapping to Observer mandates
- Dodecahedral Quorum: 20 vertex participants, 5 governance layer
- Governance Protocols: CTL, Fano Plane, meta-cognitive role assignment

### Lifecycle & Implementation

- Rectification Automaton: Event-driven, local self-healing
- Archivist Peers: Sustainable memory, archival trie
- Harmonization: Training, resolution, manifestation, homeostasis
