## Usage Commands

```bash
# Start harmonized Singularity2D demo
npm run harmonized:demo

# Build all harmonized components
npm run build:harmonized

# Run CUE core demo
npm run core:demo

# Start control center with harmonized panels
npm run control-center:dev
```

## Architecture

The harmonized components create a reusable library that:
- Integrates sacred geometry with CUE consensus mechanisms
- Provides React Three.js visualizations
- Supports real-time voting and dimensional evolution
- Maintains mathematical precision with golden ratio calculations
- Synchronizes with CUE network state

## Integration Points

1. **Sacred Geometry Engine**: Core computational layer
2. **CUE Integration Layer**: Network synchronization
3. **React Components**: Visualization and interaction
4. **Control Center**: Governance integration
5. **Singularity2D**: Full application showcase

All components are production-ready and follow TypeScript best practices.
