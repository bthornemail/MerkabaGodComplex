*   **Mechanism:** All `SignedMessage`Identity Axiom (Signature Verification)**
    1.  Deserialize the `signedSignal.payload` bytes into an `ExternalSignal` object (`signal`).
    2.  Verify the `signedSignal.signature` against the original `signedSignal.payload` bytes and the `signedSignal.source_credential_id` using the ED25519 algorithm.
    3.  If verification fails, **TERMINATE**.

    **Step 2: Internal Coherence Check (Rectification)**
    4.  Let `magnitude = currentState.internal_magnitude`.
    5.  If `magnitude % 5 !== 0` OR `magnitude % 7 !== 0`, **TERMINATE**. This check is bypassed for `rectify_state` events.

    **Step 3: Duality Law (Modulus 2)**
    6.  Let `actionKey = createCompositeKey(signal)`.
    7.  Rule: Creation events (`mint_token`) MUST have an odd `actionKey`. Modification/process events (`transfer_token`, `rectify_state`) MUST have an even `actionKey`.
    8.  If the rule is violated, **TERMINATE**.

    **Step 4: Conservation Law (Constant `168`)**
    9.  Let `conservationKey = createCompositeKey(currentState) + createCompositeKey(signal)`.
    10.  If `conservationKey % 168 !== 0`, **TERMINATE**.

    **Step 5: Poly-Axiomatic Consensus Check**
    11.  Look up the required modulus based on `signal.level` (see Appendix A).
    12.  Let `consensusKey = createCompositeKey(signal.payload)`.
    13.  If `consensusKey % requiredModulus !== 0`, **TERMINATE**.

    **Step 6: State Transition Logic**
    14.  The event is now fully validated. Apply the state change based on `signal.payload`.
    15.  **For `mint_token`:**
        *   The peer MUST verify that the `token_id` does not already exist in its `currentState.context`. If it does, **TERMINATE**.
        *   The peer MUST add a new entry to `currentState.context`, where the key is the `token_id` and the value is the serialized `TokenState` message.
        *   The peer MUST increment its `currentState.internal_magnitude` by 1.
    16.  **For `transfer_token`:**
        *   The peer MUST verify that the `token_id` exists in its `currentState.context`. If not, **TERMINATE**.
        *   The peer MUST verify that the `owner_credential_id` of the existing token matches the `signedSignal.source_credential_id`. If not, **TERMINATE**.
        *   The peer MUST update the `owner_credential_id` of the token in its `context` to the `recipient_credential_id`.
        *   The peer MUST increment its `currentState.internal_magnitude` by 1.
    17.  **For `rectify_state`:**
        *   The peer MUST set its `currentState.internal_magnitude` to a base harmonic value (e.g., `35`).

    **Step 7: Finalization**
    18.  Update `currentState.position` (e.g., increment `dimension`).
    19.  Atomically save the `newState` to persistent storage.
    20.  If the event was originated by this peer, it should now be published to the Gossipsub topic.

#### **5.3. `internalMagnitude` Formal Definition**

*   **Definition:** `internalMagnitude` is a quantifiable measure of a peer's cumulative state complexity, or "computational debt." It represents the number of successful write operations the peer has committed to its local state.
*   **Initial Value:** A new peer starts with a harmonically balanced `internalMagnitude` of `35`.
*   **Update Rule:** For every successful event that results in a write to the `context` map (`mint_token`, `transfer_token`), the `internalMagnitude` MUST be incremented by **1**.
*   **Rectification Process:** A peer can reduce its `internalMagnitude` by originating a `rectify_state` event with `level: 'LOCAL'`. This is a privileged, internal action. When a peer processes its own valid `rectify_state` event, it resets its `internalMagnitude` to the base value of `35`. This process allows a peer to "pay down" its computational debt and remain coherent, enabling it to continue performing actions on the network.

### **6. Implementation Guide**

1.  **Dependencies:** Install libraries for `libp2p`, `protobuf-js`, and a standard ED25519 implementation.
2.  **Data Structures:** Generate language-specific classes from the `cue.proto` file.
3.  **Peer Class:** Implement the `Peer` class, `ComponentState`, and state persistence.
4.  **Networking:** Initialize `libp2p` with the full stack. Implement the `Gossipsub` subscription and publish logic.
5.  **`onTick` Implementation:** Code the `onTick` function, ensuring it follows the formal algorithm precisely, including the helper functions for deterministic key generation.
6.  **Node Entry Points:** Create separate executables for running Bootstrap and Client nodes to test interoperability and network consensus.
