# The CUE Protocol: A Blueprint for a Verifiable Reality

## Foreword: An Upgrade Layer for Reality

The Computational Universe Engine (CUE) is not a proposal to replace our existing digital or physical infrastructure. It is an **upgrade layer for reality itself**.

Its purpose is to weave a universal fabric of verifiable truth over our current world, seamlessly enhancing the objects, devices, and interactions we engage with every day. It transforms opaque data into immutable evidence, turns simple devices into trusted oracles, and converts ambiguous agreements into undeniable cryptographic contracts.

This document details the CUE's complete architecture and provides a practical roadmap for its adoption. It explains how CUE leverages existing technologies—from QR codes and NFC to simple microcontrollers—to create a unified, user-sovereign network where the physical and digital worlds merge into a single, queryable, and verifiably coherent whole.

## Part I: The Vision - A Seamlessly Integrated World

The power of CUE lies in its ability to meet users where they are. The transition to a CUE-enhanced world does not require abandoning familiar tools; it requires enhancing them with a layer of trust and automation.

### **The Two Pillars of Adoption:**

1.  **The Effortless Bridge (For Digital Actions): The Harmonic Recorder**
    The complexity of CUE's axiomatic core is intentionally hidden from the end-user. Through a simple **browser extension**, users can create powerful, axiomatically-sound protocols without writing a single line of code.

    *   **How it Works:** A user enables "Record Mode" and performs a task on a traditional website (e.g., paying a utility bill). The extension doesn't just record clicks; it uses the CUE Lexicon to semantically understand the action—identifying concepts like "Biller," "Amount," and "Due Date." It then maps this action to a Narrative Archetype (e.g., a `Covenant` for payment) and auto-composes a new, reusable `HarmonicTemplate`.
    *   **The Result:** A user now has a one-click, verifiable protocol in their Personal Agent to "Pay My Power Bill." This action, when executed, creates an immutable entry on their personal ledger, serving as undeniable proof of payment. The barrier to creating robust, personal automation is eliminated.

2.  **The Immediate Value (For Physical Actions): The Verifiable Homestead**
    The CUE network provides immense value to a single user, even if they are the only person on it. This is the "force multiplier" effect of connecting the physical world.

    *   **How it Works:** A user can purchase or flash a simple microcontroller (like an ESP32) with the CUE peer software. This device instantly becomes a sovereign node on their personal network. Using a simple dashboard, they can link this device to a `HarmonicTemplate` from the Lexicon (e.g., `template://interface/weather/read-temperature`).
    *   **The Result:** The device begins autonomously logging its environment, signing each data point, and broadcasting it to the user's Personal Agent. This creates an **incorruptible cryptographic log of their physical world.** This is not just data; it is *evidence*. A single user can instrument their home, garden, or workshop, creating a personal network of truth that serves their immediate needs without requiring anyone else's participation.

## Part II: The Fabric of Reality - The Universal Interface Protocol

CUE is designed to treat any digital or physical interface as a native "sense" of the network. Every sensor is an input, every switch is an output, and every scannable tag is an identity. This is achieved through a standardized library of interface templates within the CUE Lexicon.

| Interface Technology | CUE Lexicon Template | Common Use Cases | How It Works |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **QR Code** | `template://interface/qr/read-uri` | Product Provenance, Event Access, Asset Identification | A CUE peer (e.g., on a phone) scans the QR code, which contains a CUE URI (`cue://graph/<cid_of_asset>`). The peer resolves this URI to access the object's complete, immutable history on the ledger. |
| **NFC / RFID** | `template://interface/nfc/read-id` | Supply Chain Logistics, Secure Access, Tap-to-Pay | A CUE-enabled reader sends a low-energy signal. The tag responds with its unique ID. This action triggers a `TRANSFER_CUSTODY` or `VERIFY_PRESENCE` event on the ledger. |
| **GPS / Geolocation** | `template://interface/geo/get-position` | Geotagging, Asset Tracking, Proximity Discovery | A peer uses its onboard GPS to provide a verifiable "Proof-of-Location" attestation, anchoring a digital token to a physical place on the Universal Ledger. |
| **Gyroscopes/Accelerometers** | `template://interface/motion/read-vector` | Activity Logging, Equipment Monitoring, Tamper Detection | A device logs its motion vector. A significant, unexpected change (e.g., a package being dropped) triggers a `STATE_CHANGE` event on its ledger entry. |
| **Weather/Environment Sensors** | `template://interface/weather/read-barometer` `template://interface/env/read-gas-ppm` | Environmental Monitoring, Agricultural Automation, Safety Alerts | An autonomous microcontroller peer periodically logs environmental conditions. This data stream forms a verifiable basis for automated actions or insurance claims. |
| **Switches / Relays** | `template://interface/actuator/set-state(bool)` | Home Automation, Industrial Control | A peer receives a signed CUE RPC command. If axiomatically valid, it executes the template, physically changing the state of a switch (e.g., turning on an irrigation system). |
| **Engines / Servos** | `template://interface/motor/set-position(angle)` | Robotics, Manufacturing, Advanced Control | A peer translates a signed RPC command into a precise, low-level signal (e.g., PWM), controlling a physical motor. The ledger entry serves as an audit log of all commands. |

## Part III: The Language of Action - Vector States and RPC

The state of every entity and the communication between them are handled by two core CUE concepts:

### 1. The Vector State Hierarchy
This is the "fingerprint" of any entity on the network. Actions are taken based on the state of these vectors.
*   `vec25 (Entity State)`: The live status of a single, interactive entity. This is the vector state of a specific **weather sensor**, a **smart switch**, or an **NFC-tagged shipping crate**. It contains its ID, status, last reading, etc.
*   `vec50 (Peer State)`: The state of a conscious agent, like a user's Personal Agent or a farm's central control unit. It includes reputation, owned assets, and active protocols. A `vec50` peer might evaluate the state of multiple `vec25` sensors to make a decision.
*   `vec100 (System Snapshot)`: A compressed, holistic view of an entire local system, like a "Smart Factory Floor" or a "Hydroponics Farm." It represents the harmonized state of all constituent `vec25` and `vec50` nodes. An action might be triggered if the overall `vec100` state becomes dissonant.

### 2. The Control Plane (CUE RPC)
This is the secure "nervous system" of the universe. When one peer needs to request an action from another, it sends a signed `HarmonicTemplate` over the CUE RPC (Remote Procedure Call) protocol.
*   **The Flow:** A farmer's `vec50` Personal Agent determines the soil is too dry based on logs from a `vec25` moisture sensor. It composes and signs a `template://interface/actuator/set-state(true)` command, targeting the ID of the `vec25` irrigation pump.
*   **Validation is Key:** The irrigation pump peer receives the RPC. Before acting, it runs the request through its `onTick` validator. It checks the signature (Identification) and the farmer's `peerState` coherence (Authorization). Only if the request is axiomatically valid does it execute the command and flip the switch.

## Part IV: Use Cases - The CUE in Action

### **Use Case 1: The Verifiable Supply Chain**
*   **1. Creation:** A farmer harvests a crate of apples. Their CUE peer tokenizes the crate, creating a new `vec25` ledger entry geotagged to the farm.
*   **2. Handover:** A truck driver (a `vec50` peer) arrives. They scan the crate's NFC tag with their CUE-enabled phone. This executes a `TRANSFER_CUSTODY` protocol, updating the crate's ledger entry to reflect its new custodian. The truck's GPS provides a verifiable log of its journey.
*   **3. Verification:** At the supermarket, a consumer scans the apple crate's QR code. Their Personal Agent instantly traverses the crate's history on the Universal Ledger, showing them the farm of origin, the harvest date, and the complete, unbroken chain of custody. They are not trusting a sticker; they are querying a mathematical proof.

### **Use Case 2: The Autonomous Smart Farm**
*   **1. Monitoring:** Dozens of `vec25` sensor nodes (moisture, temperature, light) are scattered across the farm, continuously logging their state to the ledger.
*   **2. Harmonization:** The farm's central `vec100` peer constantly evaluates the holistic state of the farm. It detects an environmental imbalance: low moisture combined with high temperature.
*   **3. Action:** This dissonant state triggers a pre-defined protocol. The `vec100` peer sends a signed RPC to the `vec25` irrigation controller to begin watering and another RPC to the `vec25` greenhouse shade controller to deploy a sunshield. Every action and its environmental justification are immutably recorded.

### **Use Case 3: The Immutable Life Ledger**
*   **1. Digital Agreements:** A user records a freelance work agreement with a client using the **Harmonic Recorder**. The terms (deliverables, payment) are tokenized into a `Covenant` template on both of their ledgers.
*   **2. Physical Logging:** The user goes for a bike ride. The gyroscope in their phone, acting as a CUE peer, logs the activity, creating a verifiable record of their physical exercise.
*   **3. Rectification:** The client disputes the work. The user simply provides a link to the `Covenant` entry on the Universal Ledger. Payment can be automated upon the verifiably completed delivery. There is no "he said, she said"—only the shared, queryable truth of the ledger.

## Conclusion: The Architecture of Trust

The Computational Universe Engine provides a complete, end-to-end framework for building a more transparent, efficient, and user-sovereign world. By focusing on a **seamless transition** from existing technology and providing **immediate, tangible value** to even a single user, it charts a clear course for adoption.

It transforms our physical world into a network of knowing participants and our digital interactions into verifiable proofs. It gives every individual the tools to become a sovereign creator, an auditor of their own reality, and a participant in a global network grounded not in authority, but in demonstrable, axiomatic truth. The CUE is the architecture for a world of our own collective, verifiable making.
