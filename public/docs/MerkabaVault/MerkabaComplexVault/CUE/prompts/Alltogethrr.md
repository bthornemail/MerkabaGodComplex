That is the perfect question, and it gets to the very heart of the CUE's philosophy, bridging the metaphysical lore with practical, secure implementation.

The answer is **we use both, in a two-layer model.**

We use a familiar, cryptographically secure method for **Identification** (proving *who* you are) and the CUE-native harmonic model for **Authorization & Coherence** (proving *what* you are and if you're allowed to act).

Think of it like international travel:
*   **WebAuthn (The Familiar):** This is your **Passport**. It's a globally recognized, cryptographically secure document that proves your identity. It's unforgeable and establishes that you are who you say you are.
*   **Harmonic Encoding (The CUE-Native):** This is your **Visa and your reason for entry**. It proves you understand the laws of the country you're entering and have permission to perform specific activities (work, tourism, etc.). A country might deny entry even to someone with a valid passport if they are deemed a security risk or don't have a valid reason to be there.

### Layer 1: Identification - "The Passport" (Familiar & Secure)

This layer answers the question: **"Is this peer who it claims to be?"**

*   **Technology:** **WebAuthn**.
*   **How it Works:** When a `Peer` is created, it goes through the simulated WebAuthn credential generation. This creates a unique, unforgeable cryptographic keypair.
    *   The `credentialId` becomes the peer's **immutable, public address** in the hypergraph. It's like its Social Security Number.
    *   The `privateKey` is held securely by the peer and is never shared.
*   **Why it's Essential:**
    1.  **Prevents Sybil Attacks:** It makes it computationally expensive and difficult for a single malicious actor to create millions of fake identities to overwhelm the network.
    2.  **Ensures Message Integrity:** When a peer sends a critical message (like injecting an event or casting a vote), it can *sign* that message with its private key. Other peers can use its public `credentialId` to verify that the message is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.
    3.  **Provides a Stable Foundation:** This is the bedrock of trust. Before we can even consider a peer's "harmony," we must first know, without a doubt, who we are talking to.

**In summary: We use familiar, industry-standard public-key cryptography to handle the fundamental identity of a peer.** This is a solved problem, and we should use the best tools available.

### Layer 2: Authorization & Coherence - "The Visa" (Harmonic Encoding)

This layer answers the question: **"Given who this peer is, is its current state coherent enough with the universe's laws to permit this action?"**

*   **Technology:** **CUE Axiomatic State Analysis (VectorState Analysis).**
*   **How it Works:** This is not about a password or a key. It's about the **peer's own state vector (`vec50`)**. A peer's state is a living record of its history, its knowledge, and its alignment with the universal axioms.
    *   When a peer wants to perform a high-stakes action (e.g., register a new core `ComponentTemplate`, propose a change to an axiom, or trigger a universe shift), other peers don't just check its signature.
    *   They perform a **coherence check** on the requesting peer's state. They run its `vec50` through the `ConservationLaw` and `IdentityLaw` checks.
*   **Why it's Essential:**
    1.  **Creates a Trust-Based System:** A peer that has a long history of coherent, harmonious actions will have a "healthy" state vector. The network inherently trusts this peer more. It's like a credit score for reality.
    2.  **Prevents Malicious *Actions* (not just identities):** A peer might have a valid identity (a valid passport) but might be in a dissonant or chaotic state. Harmonic authorization prevents a "sick" or "unstable" peer from damaging the core fabric of the universe.
    3.  **Implements the CUE's Philosophy:** This is what makes the CUE unique. Your right to act is not granted by an external authority; it is an emergent property of your own internal harmony with the system itself.

#### Example Scenario:

1.  **Peer-Chaos** (a peer in a dissonant state) wants to register a new `ComponentTemplate` called "VOID_ELEMENT" whose logic violates the conservation axiom.
2.  It sends a signed request to **Peer-Alpha**.
3.  **Peer-Alpha** performs its two-layer check:
    *   **Layer 1 Check:** "Is the signature from Peer-Chaos valid?" It checks the signature against Peer-Chaos's public `credentialId`. **Result: PASS.** The identity is valid.
    *   **Layer 2 Check:** "Is Peer-Chaos's state coherent enough to perform this critical action?" Peer-Alpha requests Peer-Chaos's `vec50` state vector and runs it through the `ConservationLaw`. **Result: FAIL.** The vector is highly dissonant.
4.  **Peer-Alpha denies the registration request.** Its response is essentially: "I have verified your identity, but your current state is not in harmony with the universe's laws. You are not authorized to make such a fundamental change at this time. Rectify your state and try again."

### Conclusion

You are absolutely right to question this. The optimal solution is a hybrid one that leverages the best of both worlds:

*   **WebAuthn:** Provides the robust, secure, and familiar foundation for **Identity**. It's the unforgeable lock on the door.
*   **Harmonic Encoding:** Provides the novel, CUE-native, and philosophically consistent system for **Authorization**. It's the secret knock that proves you belong inside and understand the rules.

This two-layer approach makes the CUE both practically secure against real-world attacks and theoretically consistent with its own profound internal logic.
