# Exam Verification System: Development Outline

## Phase 1: Core Components

### Answer Class
1. Create a class to represent individual answers.
2. Add attributes for ID, answer text, score, and weight.
3. Implement methods to sign and verify answers.

### Test Class
1. Create a class to represent a test with multiple questions and answers.
2. Add attributes for questions, answers, total score, and weight within the exam.
3. Implement methods to add answers, sign answers, verify answers, and calculate the total score.

### Task Class
1. Create a class to represent individual tasks.
2. Add attributes for the task objective, completion status, delegate signature, weight, and score.
3. Implement methods to mark a task as completed and verify completion.

### Exam Class
1. Create a class to represent an exam that includes a test and a task.
2. Add attributes to store the test and task instances, as well as Content IDs (CIDs) for immutable storage.
3. Implement methods to save and load exam states, and to determine if the exam is passed or failed.

## Phase 2: Storage Integration (Helia / IPFS)

1. Implement the `add` method to save the current state of an exam to Helia.
2. Implement the `get` method to retrieve the state of an exam from Helia using a CID.

## Phase 3: User Interface (Optional)

1. Develop a simple user interface to create tests and tasks.
2. Add functionality to sign and verify answers and tasks.
3. Display the results of the exam and whether it is passed or failed.

## Phase 4: Testing and Quality Assurance

1. Write unit tests for all core components.
2. Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together as expected.
3. Conduct security audits to identify any vulnerabilities.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1. Prepare the code for production deployment.
2. Deploy the application to a server or cloud service.
3. Ensure that the application is scalable and can handle multiple users.

## Phase 6: Documentation and Training

1. Write comprehensive documentation for the application.
2. Create user guides and tutorials.
3. Train end-users and administrators on how to use the application effectively.

## Additional Features (Optional)

1. Add support for multiple types of questions (e.g., fill-in-the-blank, short answer).
2. Implement a grading system with customizable grading criteria.
3. Add analytics to track user performance over time.
