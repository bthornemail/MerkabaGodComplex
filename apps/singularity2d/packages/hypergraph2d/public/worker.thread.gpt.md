You're absolutely correct—broadcast groups can simplify inter-agent communication significantly! Instead of dealing with MessageChannel complexity and explicit port management, a broadcast system allows agents to send and receive messages effortlessly.

Here’s how you can implement it:

Broadcast Groups with Worker Threads

How It Works

1. Manager Creates Broadcast Group:

The manager acts as the central hub.

It forwards messages to all agents in the group.



2. Agents Send Messages to Manager:

Agents post messages to the manager.

The manager broadcasts these messages to the group.

Implementation

1. Manager Code

const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

class BroadcastManager {
    constructor() {
        this.agents = [];
    }

    addAgent(agentScript) {
        const agent = new Worker(agentScript);
        this.agents.push(agent);

        // Listen for messages from the agent
        agent.on('message', (message) => {
            console.log(`[Manager] Received from Agent: ${message}`);

            // Broadcast the message to all agents except the sender
            this.broadcast(message, agent);
        });

        return agent;
    }

    broadcast(message, sender) {
        this.agents.forEach((agent) => {
            if (agent !== sender) {
                agent.postMessage(message);
            }
        });
    }

    terminateAll() {
        this.agents.forEach((agent) => agent.terminate());
    }
}

// Usage
const manager = new BroadcastManager();
manager.addAgent('./agent.js');
manager.addAgent('./agent.js');

// Terminate after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => {
    manager.terminateAll();
    console.log('All agents terminated');
}, 5000);

2. Agent Code

Each agent listens for messages from the manager and sends its own messages.

const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

// Listen for broadcast messages from the manager
parentPort.on('message', (message) => {
    console.log(`Agent received broadcast: ${message}`);
});

// Simulate sending a message to the group
setTimeout(() => {
    parentPort.postMessage('Hello from Agent');
}, Math.random() * 2000); // Random delay to simulate asynchronous behavior

Advantages of Broadcast Groups

1. Simplicity:

No need to manage ports or transfer lists.

Just send messages to the Manager, and it handles distribution.



2. Flexible Communication:

Broadcast groups can scale easily.

New agents can be added dynamically.



3. Centralized Control:

The manager can inspect, modify, or filter messages before broadcasting.

Output Example

[Manager] Received from Agent: Hello from Agent
Agent received broadcast: Hello from Agent
[Manager] Received from Agent: Hello from Agent
Agent received broadcast: Hello from Agent
All agents terminated

This setup is lightweight and avoids the complexities of MessageChannel. It’s perfect for scenarios where agents need to communicate in a shared group efficiently.
