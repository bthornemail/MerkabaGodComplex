# Exam Verification System: Features and Limitations

## Features

### Secure and Tamper-proof
1. Cryptographic signing ensures the integrity of answers and tasks.
2. Immutable storage via Helia (IPFS-based) ensures that once data is saved, it cannot be altered.

### Extensible and Modular
1. Separate classes for answers, tests, tasks, and exams make it easy to extend functionality.
2. Can be integrated with other systems and databases.

### Weighted Scoring
1. Supports individual weights and scores for answers, tasks, and tests.
2. Customizable grading criteria can be applied.

### Verification and Auditing
1. All signed data can be verified for authenticity.
2. Provides an audit trail via the series of Content IDs (CIDs).

### Flexibility
1. Can be used for multiple types of assessments: educational, corporate training, and professional certifications.

## Limitations

### Complexity
1. Implementing cryptographic signing and verification may add complexity to the system.

### Storage Requirements
1. Storing exam states immutably can lead to increased storage costs over time.

### User Interface
1. The core components do not include a user interface; this needs to be developed separately.

### Dependency on External Libraries
1. Relies on external libraries like ethers.js for cryptographic functions.

### Network Dependence
1. If using a decentralized storage like IPFS, network availability and latency can be issues.

### Initial Setup
1. Requires initial setup for integrating with storage and possibly other third-party services.
