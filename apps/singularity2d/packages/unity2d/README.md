## Decentralized Double Entry Neural Network Transformer DAG Blockchain Graph

### Overview
This project aims to create a decentralized ledger system leveraging a Neural Network Transformer-based Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain graph. It utilizes a Continuous Integration and Deployment (CID) mechanism along with SHA hashed raw string encoding for data integrity and security. The system validates nodes through offline or peer signatures and dynamically adds them to the graph. Additionally, it predicts missing nodes and searches peers for them to enhance the integrity and completeness of the blockchain graph.

### Features
1. **Decentralization**: The ledger operates in a decentralized manner, eliminating single points of failure and ensuring data resilience.
2. **Double Entry System**: Utilizes a double-entry accounting system to maintain accurate records of transactions and balances.
3. **Memory Array Buffer**: Implements a memory array buffer to efficiently handle data storage and retrieval.
4. **SHA Hashing**: Utilizes SHA hashing for data integrity and security, ensuring that data cannot be tampered with.
5. **Raw String Encoding**: Data is encoded using raw string encoding techniques to optimize storage and processing efficiency.
6. **Neural Network Transformer**: Integrates a neural network transformer model to analyze and process data, enhancing the system's predictive capabilities.
7. **DAG Blockchain Graph**: Implements a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) blockchain graph structure to organize and manage transactions.
8. **Validation Mechanism**: Validates nodes using offline or peer signatures to verify the authenticity of transactions and data.
9. **Dynamic Node Addition**: Dynamically adds validated nodes to the blockchain graph, ensuring the integrity and completeness of the ledger.
10. **Node Prediction**: Predicts missing nodes within the graph to maintain data consistency and accuracy.
11. **Peer Search**: Searches for missing nodes among peers to enhance the efficiency of graph building.
12. **Nearest Neighbor Search**: Utilizes a nearest neighbor search algorithm to locate missing nodes based on data from peers.
