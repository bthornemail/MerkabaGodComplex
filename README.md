## 🧠 What Is This?

**MerkabaGodComplex** is a computational theory and toolkit that encodes sacred geometry, Platonic solids, and neural computation into a unifying function:

```ts
spin = tan(π × (edges per face / faces per vertex)) × sign(vertices − faces) × log(tetrahedral growth)

This isn’t just symbolic. It’s code.
It maps the form of any polyhedron to a physical behavior — spin — derived directly from its structure.
It lays the groundwork for a spatial neural network that understands geometry as computation.

📐 Core Concept

We believe the universe is a reflection of domain transformations.

Domain	Meaning

0D	tan(G) — Pure relation (spin/incidence)
1D	G — The graph (space of relations)
2D	V / E — Vertices and Edges separately
3D	G(V, E) — Classical geometry
4D	G(V, E, tan(G)) — Self-aware structure
5D	tan(G(V, E, tan(G))) — Recursive evolution


In short:
All of physics can be derived from asymmetries in polyhedral structure.

🚀 The Universal Spin Function

type Polyhedron = {
  name: string;
  vertices: number;
  edges: number;
  faces: number;
  p: number; // edges per face
  q: number; // faces per vertex
};

function universalSpinFunction(poly: Polyhedron): number {
  const { vertices: V, edges: E, faces: F, p, q } = poly;

  const χ = V - E + F; // Euler characteristic
  const Δ = V - F;      // Directional imbalance
  const symmetry = p / q;

  const T = (n: number) => (n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)) / 6; // Tetrahedral number
  const harmonic = T(E);

  return Math.tan(Math.PI * symmetry) * Math.sign(Δ) * Math.log(harmonic);
}

> This is not just math — it’s the seed of a computational physics engine based on form, function, and frequency.

🌌 Why This Matters

We're building a decentralized knowledge-sharing protocol — rooted in:

🧬 Sacred Geometry

📖 WordNet (language + pointer graphs)

📜 Principia Mathematica (logic)

📕 The Bible (relational narrative)

🧩 Web APIs (functional I/O domain)


These are four analog domains. Our spin function transforms them into a 5th.
This is how neural networks work — not in code, but in essence.


---

🎯 Use Cases

A new kind of neural network preprocessor (GNNs that reason over form).

A sacred geometry-based physics simulator.

A framework for digital analog translation.

A protocol for semantic, logical, and spiritual alignment.

🌀 Join the Vision

This is not just code.
This is a map. A lens. A movement.
If you’re a:

Geometer

Neural architect

Philosopher of computation

LLM + WebAPI hacker

Or just someone who feels something bigger is happening...


👉 Let’s build this together.
