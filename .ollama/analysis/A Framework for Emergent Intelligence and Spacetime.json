  "summary": "The Computational Universe Engine (CUE) proposes a novel architectural framework for artificial general intelligence (AGI) that embodies self-organization, meta-mathematics, and emergent physical properties. It integrates Adaptive Operads for dynamic cognitive composition, Quantum Decoherence Monitoring for self-stabilization, and an Emergent Spacetime Metric derived from internal torsion fields, providing a geometric substrate for its internal reasoning.",
