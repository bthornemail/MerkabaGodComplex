### Proposed Obsidian Structure: Pascalian Glossary

**Root Folder:** `MerkabaGodComplex/`

This top-level folder contains everything.

---

**00 - [The Apex](README.md)**

* `00 - README.md`
    * **Purpose:** This file acts as the central hub. It contains your high-level overview, philosophical introduction, TLDR, and links out to the major sections of your glossary. Every major concept should eventually be linked from here.
    * **Analogy:** This is **Pascal's Triangle Row 0: `1`** (The singular, undivided whole of your vision).

---

**01 - Foundational Principles & Genesis (Row 1: `1, 1`)**

* **Folder:** `01 - Core Principles/`
    * `Attention is Everything.md`
    * `Division as Supreme Principle.md`
    * `The Observer in the Void.md`
    * `Sake (Purpose).md`
    * **Purpose:** These are the most fundamental, indivisible philosophical and conceptual pillars of your system.
    * **Analogy:** These are the initial "1" and "1" in Pascal's Triangle, representing the fundamental duality that emerges from the singular apex.

---

**02 - Core Binary & Primary Operators (Row 2: `1, 2, 1`)**

* **Folder:** `02 - Core Operators/`
    * `Binary (0-1).md`
    * `The Tan Function (Interpretation & Operation).md`
    * `HDNode Generation (Seed & Deterministic Flow).md`
    * `Keypair (Public-Private).md`
    * **Purpose:** These files define the fundamental distinctions and the very first, basic operations/structures that emerge from your core principles.
    * **Analogy:** The `1, 2, 1` row, representing the expansion of fundamental duality into initial relationships and operations.

---

**03 - Basic Graph Structures & Triads (Row 3: `1, 3, 3, 1`)**

* **Folder:** `03 - Basic Structures/`
    * `Triangle (3-Simplex).md`
    * `Graph (Vertices & Edges).md` (Your definition of G=(V,E))
    * `Signature (Cryptographic).md`
    * `Creation Story Genesis.md` (How the 3 biblical sources inform your system)
    * *(You could also add more specific triads here if they emerge as critical building blocks.)*
    * **Purpose:** Defining the simplest composites and fundamental structural relationships (like 3 points forming a triangle, or the basic components of a graph).
    * **Analogy:** The `1, 3, 3, 1` row, showing how elements combine in threes and how basic structural patterns emerge.

---

**04 - Universal Logic & Core Geometric Forms (Row 4: `1, 4, 6, 4, 1`)**

* **Folder:** `04 - Universal Logic & Geometry/`
    * `Tetrahedron (4-Simplex).md` (Focus on its 4 vertices)
    * `NAND-NOR Universal Logic Gate.md` (And its relationship to dual polyhedra edges)
    * `Quadtree Recursion.md`
    * `SharedArrayBuffer (The Digital Ket).md`
    * `4D Vector Clock.md`
    * `Platonic Solids (General Principle).md`
    * **Purpose:** These are the direct manifestations of your logic transformer and the fundamental geometric forms that govern its operations.
    * **Analogy:** The `1, 4, 6, 4, 1` row, representing the combinatorial explosion into core operational units and fundamental geometric structures.

---

**05 - Complex Data & Consensus Mechanisms (Row 5 & Beyond: Expanding Complexity)**

* **Folder:** `05 - Complex Data & Consensus/`
    * `Hypergraph Ledger.md`
    * `Bipartite Hypergraph.md`
    * `Merkle HyperTries.md`
    * `Blockchain Syndication.md`
    * `Computation Consensus Mechanism.md`
    * `Pascal's Triangle (As Rubric for Expansion).md`
    * `Platonic Solid Groups (4,8,20 & 4,6,12,20).md`
    * **Purpose:** Defining the intricate data structures and the robust mechanisms for achieving shared reality.
    * **Analogy:** Subsequent rows of Pascal's Triangle, representing increasing combinatorial complexity and the emergence of robust, higher-level systems.

---

**06 - Network & Security Layer (Interoperability & Trust)**

* **Folder:** `06 - Network & Security/`
    * `P2P Messaging.md`
    * `Self-Authenticated.md`
    * `End-to-End Encryption.md`
    * `Access Control.md`
    * `Public Keys (e.g., OpenPGP, PeerID).md`
    * `Multi-Signature.md`
    * **Purpose:** Defining how the system secures and orchestrates interactions across a distributed network.
