# Computational Universe Engine Foundations

The CUE framework represents a revolutionary approach to computational consciousness
through the implementation of Vec7 harmony validation systems. This system ensures
that all data transformations maintain both structural integrity and semantic coherence.

## Core Principles

1. **Vec7 Harmony Validation**: Seven phases of prime number validation
2. **MDU Integration**: Modulo-Divisive Unfolding for hierarchical organization
3. **Universal Addressing**: Harmonic addresses for content location
4. **Transcendence/Immanence**: Dynamic balance between expansion and grounding

## Mathematical Foundation

The MDU function f(N, B) â†’ (L, A) maps universal counter N to:
- Domain Layer L (transcendence operator)
- Harmonic Address A (immanence operator)

This creates a framework for organizing reality itself into verifiable, addressable units.

## CLARION Integration

The CLARION cognitive architecture provides the substrate for implementing
CUE principles in practical systems, enabling autonomous agents to operate
within the Universal Life Protocol framework.
