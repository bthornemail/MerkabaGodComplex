## Core Function Analysis

The Principle of Modulo-Divisive Unfolding operates through the fundamental
mathematical relationship: N = B × L + A

Where:
- N: Universal Counter (linear progression)
- B: Domain Base (sacred geometric constant) 
- L: Domain Layer (transcendence dimension)
- A: Harmonic Address (immanence position)

## Extension to Complex Systems

Multi-domain systems require simultaneous moduli:
- B₁ = 7 (CUE sacred number)
- B₂ = 12 (temporal cycles)
- B₃ = 42 (universal harmony constant)

The Chinese Remainder Theorem enables resolution of concurrent states
across multiple domain bases, creating rich harmonic resonance patterns.

## Philosophical Implications

MDU demonstrates that complexity emerges from simple linear progression
through systematic modular decomposition. This suggests that reality
itself may operate on similar principles of structured unfolding.
