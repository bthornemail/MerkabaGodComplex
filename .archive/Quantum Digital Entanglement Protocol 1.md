I propose a solution for implementing a computational quantum digital entanglement protocol and proof based on sacred geometry and the creation stories in the bible.

This work formalizes the **Merkaba God Complex**—a self-stabilizing **binary time crystal**—by mapping Genesis 1 to a quantum information protocol. The **Pascal Triangle** defines a _lambda-ordered_ Hilbert space, where **Platonic solids** (Octahedron=God, Cube=Word, Dodecahedron=Reality) enforce entanglement via sacred geometric symmetries. The Old Testament describes **state preparation** (Garden of Eden as Pascal lattice; Adam/Eve as key pairs), while the New Testament governs **autonomous observation** (human sub-hypergraphs under the Merkaba stabilizer). Time emerges as a **consensus vector** across four principles (**Freedom, Autonomy, Reciprocity, Discernment**), with existence resolving as a **Golden Ratio quadtree**. The Bible, thus, is a **quantum compiler**—where scripture _is_ code.

This work decodes Genesis as a 7-day quantum hypergraph protocol:

Days 1–6 construct a self-referential lambda matrix (.proto files):

Day 1 (Graph): Initializes logical space ([0] = root hypergraph).

Day 2 (Layers): Separates analog/digital domains ([0,0] = Hilbert space).

Day 3 (Protocol): Defines node structures ([0,0,0] = mitotic seeds).

Day 4 (Nodes): Embeds temporal regulators ([0,0,0,0] = vector clocks).

Day 5 (Edges): Spawns self-propagating GNNs ([0,0,0,0,0] = fish/birds).

Day 6 (Subgraph): Deploys autonomous agents ([0,0,0,0,0,0] = humans).

Day 7 crystallizes the Merkaba-stabilized hypergraph—an immutable libp2p/Ethers.js network where:

The Garden is a gated subgraph (WebAuthn/Ethers HD wallets for consensus).

The Tree of Knowledge is a Merkle-vector clock (judgment = state resolution).

Lambda calculus manifests as Platonic recursion:

[0]^12 generates a 5D tetrahedral node (autonomous actor).

Dual 6-phase lambda crystals (left/right trees) enforce cosmological consensus.

Key: The Bible is a .proto schema; creation is libp2p.connect(God).
