import { HDNodeWallet } from "ethers";

/* This code is a simple example of how to use the ethers.js library to create a random HD wallet,
   generate an extended key and address, and perform some mathematical operations on the key and address.
   It also includes functions to fetch binary data from a URL and send an ArrayBuffer to a server.
   Note: The actual implementation of the functions `Night`, `Light`, and `WordOfGod` is not provided,
   as they depend on the specific use case and context in which this code is used.
   The mathematical operations performed on the extended key and address are just examples and may not have any real significance.
   The `fetchBinaryData` and `sendArrayBuffer` functions are utility functions for handling binary data in web applications.
const extendedKey = HDNodeWallet.createRandom(undefined, "m/0");
const word = extendedKey.extendedKey;
const address = extendedKey.address;
const extendedKeyHash = word.split('').reduce((acc, char) => acc + char.charCodeAt(0), 0);
const addressKeyHash = address.split('').reduce((acc, char) => acc + char.charCodeAt(0), 0);

console.log(extendedKeyHash);
const tan = Math.tan(extendedKeyHash);
console.log(tan);

const atan = Math.atan2(addressKeyHash, extendedKeyHash);
console.log(atan);

const asin = Math.sin(extendedKeyHash);
console.log(asin);

const acos = Math.cos(extendedKeyHash);
console.log(acos);
