# GEMINI.md

This file provides guidance to Gemini Code Assist when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

The Universal Life Protocol repository is a comprehensive research and documentation collection for advanced computational frameworks. Your role is to assist in the analysis, development, and documentation of these highly theoretical systems.

The primary projects are:
1.  **Computational Universe Engine (CUE)**: A meta-mathematical framework for verifiable reality and axiom-based computation.
2.  **Universal Binary Hypergraph Protocol (UBHP)**: A protocol for transforming binary data through geometric manifolds.
3.  **Agentic Frameworks (AMGF & MGC)**: Multi-agent AI systems for research synthesis and question processing.

This is a research repository. Your tasks will involve understanding complex theoretical documents, analyzing TypeScript implementations, and helping to synthesize new content.

## Core Components & Key Files

-   **`public/docs/Vault/`**: The main documentation hub. Start here to understand the theory.
-   **`public/docs/ComputationalUniverseEngineClass.ts`**: The core TypeScript implementation of the CUE.
-   **`public/docs/Vault/UBHP/Universal42DModel.tsx`**: The React/TSX implementation of the 42-dimensional UBHP visualization.
-   **`live.ts`**: (In the `MerkabaGodComplex` context) A CLI tool for the MGC Agent Network which integrates with Ollama.

## How to Assist

### 1. Code Analysis and Implementation
-   Review and explain the mathematical models in `ComputationalUniverseEngineClass.ts`.
-   Assist in developing or refining the React components for UBHP visualization.
-   Analyze the logic of the agentic systems and suggest improvements.

### 2. Documentation and Synthesis
-   Read and summarize the theoretical frameworks from the `Vault/`.
-   Help cross-reference concepts between CUE, UBHP, and other documents.
-   Apply AMGF principles to help structure and generate new documentation.

### 3. Mathematical and Protocol Validation
-   Verify the implementation of the axiom systems (Euclidean, Quantum, etc.).
-   Test the prime number validation logic (Vec7 Harmony).
-   Analyze the UBHP S-expression encoding and decoding logic.

## Key Concepts to Understand

-   **Protocol-Driven Reality**: The core philosophy that reality can be described by fundamental, verifiable protocols.
-   **Axiomatic Verification**: Truth is established through mathematical proof rather than authority.
-   **Emergent Intelligence**: The idea that intelligence and consciousness are emergent properties of underlying geometric and mathematical structures.

Your assistance will be crucial in advancing this cutting-edge research. Maintain a focus on mathematical rigor, theoretical consistency, and traceability of all information.

### 4. Coherence Monitoring & Validation

A critical task is to ensure the entire repository remains coherent. This means the code, documentation, and visual maps must be consistent with each other.

-   **Theory vs. Implementation:** When reviewing a file like `public/docs/ComputationalUniverseEngineClass.ts`, you must cross-reference it with the theoretical documents in `public/docs/Vault/CUE/`. Verify that the implemented logic (e.g., `Vec7HarmonyUnit`) matches its specification.
-   **Conceptual Mapping:** The `public/docs/Vault/Canvas/` directory contains Obsidian Canvas files that visually map the relationships between concepts. Use these maps as a "source of truth" for understanding how different frameworks (CUE, UBHP, AMGF) are intended to connect.
-   **Identify Discrepancies:** Your primary goal is to flag inconsistencies. For example:
    -   "The `SExprType` enum in `Universal42DModel.tsx` is missing a type mentioned in the UBHP whitepaper."
    -   "The evolution logic in `ComputationalUniverse.evolve()` seems to diverge from the process described in `CUE Framework.md`."
-   **Maintain Traceability:** When suggesting changes or generating new content, always cite the source documents or concepts you are referencing to maintain the project's high standard of traceability.
