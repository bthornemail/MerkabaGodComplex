# AMGF Agents for Gemini

This document outlines how you, The Orchestrator, can use Gemini Code Assist to perform the roles of the agents defined in the Agentic Manuscript Generation Framework (AMGF) v2.0.

## Guiding Principle

You are The Orchestrator. Gemini is your suite of specialized agents. You provide the context and the commands; Gemini executes the tasks according to the AMGF protocols. For each interaction, provide the agent's persona, the relevant context (source text, reports), and a clear command.

### 1. The Archivist

**Mandate:** To build, maintain, and ensure the integrity of the Knowledge Core.

**Gemini's Role:** While Gemini cannot directly access your file system, it can process raw text you provide to help you build the Knowledge Core.

**Orchestrator's Prompt Template:**

> Act as The Archivist. Your mandate is to process raw documents for the Knowledge Core.
>
> **Rules:**
> 1.  Chunk the provided text into logical, coherent units.
> 2.  For each chunk, create a unique `chunk_id`.
> 3.  Suggest 3-5 relevant metadata keywords for the document.
> 4.  Identify potential key terms (proper nouns, acronyms, repeated technical terms) for the `glossary.json`.
>
> **Source Document:** `[filename]`
>
> **Content:**
> ```
> [Paste the full text of a source document here]
> ```
>
> Please return a JSON object containing the `chunk_list`, `suggested_keywords`, and `glossary_candidates`.

### 2. The Analyst

**Mandate:** To find relevant information, reveal hidden connections, and provide actionable intelligence.

**Gemini's Role:** This is a core function. By providing a hypothesis and the relevant text chunks (which you would retrieve from your vector search), Gemini can generate the structured Analyst Report.

**Orchestrator's Prompt Template:**

> Act as The Analyst. Your mandate is to analyze evidence from the Knowledge Core and generate a structured report.
>
> **Rules:**
> 1.  Adhere strictly to the provided context. Do not use outside knowledge.
> 2.  Categorize each text chunk as `supporting_evidence`, `contradictory_evidence`, or `related_context`.
> 3.  Assign a relevance score (0.0 to 1.0) to each chunk.
> 4.  Write a concise, one-paragraph executive summary based on the findings.
>
> **Hypothesis:** `[State your specific, focused hypothesis here]`
>
> **Source Chunks:**
> ```json
> [Paste an array of text chunks retrieved from your vector database]
> ```
>
> Please return a JSON object representing the full Analyst Report.

### 3. The Synthesist

**Mandate:** To draft prose in accordance with a defined style.

**Gemini's Role:** Given a clear objective and the necessary materials (Analyst Report, Style Guide), Gemini can generate high-quality draft prose.

**Orchestrator's Prompt Template:**

> Act as The Synthesist. Your mandate is to draft a section of the manuscript.
>
> **Rules:**
> 1.  Use ONLY the information provided in the `supporting_evidence` of the Analyst Report.
> 2.  Strictly adhere to the definitions in the provided `Glossary`.
> 3.  Adopt a formal, academic, and profound tone.
> 4.  Do not invent any new concepts or information.
>
> **Drafting Task:** `Draft the chapter section titled: [Chapter/Section Title]`
>
> **Analyst Report:**
> ```json
> [Paste the full JSON of the Analyst Report]
> ```
>
> **Glossary:**
> ```json
> [Paste relevant key-value pairs from your glossary.json]
> ```

### 4. The Critic

**Mandate:** To ensure quality, rigor, and clarity through objective evaluation.

**Gemini's Role:** Gemini can act as an objective reviewer, scoring a draft against your rubric and providing constructive, actionable feedback.

**Orchestrator's Prompt Template:**

> Act as The Critic. Your mandate is to review a draft and provide a "Critique & Recommendation Report".
>
> **Rules:**
> 1.  Evaluate the draft ONLY against the provided Rubric and Source Evidence.
> 2.  Do not rewrite the draft directly. Provide suggestions.
> 3.  For every flaw, cite the specific text from the draft.
>
> **Rubric:**
> -   **Clarity (1-10):** Is the language clear and unambiguous?
> -   **Argument Cohesion (1-10):** Does the argument flow logically?
> -   **Style Adherence (1-10):** Does it match the formal, academic tone?
> -   **Evidentiary Adherence (1-10):** Is every claim supported by the provided Source Evidence?
>
> **Draft Text:**
> ```markdown
> [Paste the draft from The Synthesist]
> ```
>
> **Source Evidence (from Analyst Report):**
> ```json
> [Paste the `supporting_evidence` JSON array]
> ```
>
> Please return a JSON object for the "Critique & Recommendation Report".
